O que eu penso sobre web3

Almost everything web3-related is a grift based on getting people to buy crypto. Although the distributed part of blockchain technology is sort of neat, it’s not that ground-breaking, as having stuff distributed is the whole basis of internet technology since the very beginnning.

There have been fine peer-to-peer systems for decades. But apart from being a money grab, blockchains are insanely inefficient. To the point that I’m just scared of the whole technology because of the climate impact it has.

What am I even talking about?

I assume you already know all the terms I’m using in this post, but just so we’re all on the same proverbial page, I’m listing here some terms with the meanings I’ve attached to them.

Blockchain
    A database maintained by a number of one or more distributed nodes that may be owned by different people
NFT
    Non-fungible token, meaning a token that's unique and thus not replaceable with another one. Most known as a purchase receipt for a particular, unique item, such as a digital image.
Token
    A piece of data that can be owned and passed on between users of a blockchain. The nodes maintaining the blockchain can poll the other nodes to find out what's the consensus around who owns the token and, usually, what transactions it went through.
web3
    Blockchain applications

I noticed that almost everybody evangelizing Web3 owns crypto currency. I can’t assume these people can be objective in their motivations and communication—their chance of ever making a profit depends on greater fools buying tokens after them. And few people can be honest enough with themselves to admit that they put their savings into what they now believe is a pyramid scheme. But why are others so shy to speak out against these projects?

One reason is that they do not have a financial stake in the situation. They have nothing to gain from speaking out and only risk losing friendships. But now we have big brands like Adidas and CNN making the hype more mainstream. There’s enough money in crypto to cause a financial crisis when it all crashes down. And our literal climate is put at even higher risk. So I feel we need more opposing voices.

For a long time, I felt not competent enough to write anything about web3. And I didn’t want to look like an old man yelling at a cloud. Having been on a leave for some months now, I’ve spent too much time on too many web3 websites and Discords. And I still had hope—there must be something good about web3, right? After all, it’s the web!? And web is awesome!

I was excited about a new web. And if web3 would be an empty hype, I’d have to believe that many people are full of shit and others are way too gullible. I did encounter many suspicious things, like a carbon offset token selling at $300+/tonne whereas buying and canceling European carbon credits (one of the most effective, but also expensive offsetting measures) can be done at about a quarter of that price. I still believed it was interesting and that people couldn’t be setting up a scam under the pretense of protecting the climate.

Then I read tante’s article, [The Third Web](LINK). The author has a major in comp sci and a minor in philosophy. The article rips apart the idea that there’s anything amazing about blockchain tech. Now I don’t have to wonder about that part anymore, it’s easier for me to see these projects for what they really are.

Blockchain projects typically promise to solve some of the following problems:

    Concentration of power: a handful of companies are getting increased control of all online services. This is bad because their ethics (or lack thereof) aren’t aligned with ours.
    Trust: to trade online, you need to be able to trust your anonymous or pseudonymous partner. Distributed services don’t have a central authority checking who’s who, so this is extra important when problem 1 is solved.

Unfortunately neither are been solved by blockchain projects. What’s worse, blockchains are awful for private interactions.
