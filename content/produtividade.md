### Tiago Forte's P.A.R.A Method:

Personal knowledge management in a world of infinite information is a superpower. Tiago Forte is the leading authority on the subject and has coached over 20,000 people in the art of 'Building a Second Brain'. His courses are too dear for me as a college student but I've found Nat Eliason's [blog post](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam) about how to apply his approach to Roam Research (the latest, sexiest productivity tool) very helpful.

## Introdução

‍A common trope often cited when somebody offers productivity advice is that ***"there's no point climbing the ladder rapidly only to get to the top and realise that it was leaning against the wrong wall"***. ie. there's no point doing the wrong thing efficiently. 

The book that best explores this is [The Effective Executive](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxzYWppdHRvdXJpc218Z3g6MjQ1N2M2OGQ4YWIwOTcyYw) by Pete Drucker. Once we've overcome this hurdle, there are plenty of ways to enhance efficiency.

## 1. Princípios

> Spoiler: produtividade diz respeito ao processo, não ao instrumento.

Trabalhando com várias equipes, tive a oportunidade de experimentar Asana, Basecamp, rastreadores de tarefas internos e muito mais.

O problema com essas ferramentas é que elas são tudo ou nada. Ou toda a sua equipe está a bordo, finalizando tarefas diligentemente e enviando materiais de apoio, ou não. Se apenas 1 ou 2 pessoas não participanrem, o embalo de trabalho acaba.

Como só podemos controlar nossas próprias ações, optei por enfrentar um único ponto de falha (eu) para construir as ferramentas que preciso para permanecer produtivo no trabalho.

Neste artigo está como eu me organizo.

### Set Aside Large Quanta of Time:

This idea, taken from Drucker's aforementioned book, underpins most productivity books worth reading today. Namely: 

- [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) by Cal Newport 
- [The One Thing](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00D3J2QKW/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0) by Gary Keller. 
 
Basically, you need big blocks of uninterrupted time to focus deeply on one thing without being distracted by minutiae. This can be achieved through *['Time Blocking'](https://doist.com/blog/time-blocking/)* which Keller describes as "productivity’s greatest power tool.”

Vamos passar por cada elemento visível para entender como eu trabalho.

## 4. Calendário

work doesn’t happen unless you’re awake.

my usual alarm is 8:05 am but sometimes i wake up earlier to pee and just… stay up. today was one of those days, i got up at 7am and am taking advantage of the early start to write this post.

for starters, i track almost everything in Google Calendar. most people just use it for appointments with other people, but i use it to make appointments with myself.

    “set up X campaign”
    “check in with Y team member about Z”

here’s my calendar.

the colors aren’t me being cute, they’re assigned per shared calendar:

here we count 5 projects (Fomo, Cross Sell, Fork Equity, GrowthX Academy, Lobiloo).

i have a few more, but they’re small enough to not warrant their own calendar.

small project tasks are assigned to my personal calendar, and the named calendars are shared from that G Suite account to my personal Gmail.

this lets me create and manage events for multiple email domains from my personal calendar (ryanckulp@gmail.com).

### takeaway

schedule your day in advance, then wake up and do what your calendar says.

you’re less likely to let “mood” affect productivity if you have a clear set of well-defined tasks.

## 5. Abas

i keep a few browser tabs in play:

    Google Calendar (always far left, hotkey cmd+1)
    Email (sometimes 1-3 inbox tabs via Gmail’s “multiple inbox” feature)
    Trello (open 50% of the time for team collab, but i close it if heads down)

it’s easy to succumb to open-tab hell; 3.5 years ago when i was fat i wrote a song about it.

what works for me:

    only look at newsletters (ie GrowthHackers, HackerNewsletter, etc) on Fridays
    only read in the mornings

my rule: if it’s not in the Calendar, it doesn’t happen. this includes friends who want to meet for coffee but don’t send an invite. does. not. happen.

## 6. Dock

this is “max capacity” for me. Slack, Photoshop, Chrome, Terminal, and Atom are all i need. the blue/white circle is 1pass, my password manager.

the Chrome window beside the trash can is actually Lobiloo‘s gmail account, which i keep logged in, incognito in my dock in case of customer support issues.

this allows me to hover the small Lobiloo Chrome window icon a few times throughout the day, and if there’s a new email it will say so:

## 7. Trello

i’ve used Basecamp, it’s great. i’ve used Asana, it’s great too. but Trello is a lot faster, and i value speed over details.

Fomo has a “team” account (free plan) with several underlying Boards:

Fomo's Trello boards

for the most part we follow this List convention for each board:

    Icebox (ideas, not fully vetted or approved)
    To Do (generally approved ideas, more details)
    Doing (being worked on right now + person is attached to the card)
    Review (optional, ie if something is a “big change” or requires QA)
    Done (you guessed it, LIVE in production. sometimes we move from Doing -> Done directly)

for each of my side projects i have just 1 board with separate lists for bugs, marketing campaigns, customer support, etc.

## 8. email

i’m addicted to Inbox Zero.

realistically i hit it 2-3x /month on my Fomo inbox and 1-2x /week in my side project inboxes.

when i respond to a message or it’s no longer in “my court,” i move it to a folder.

    Accounts
    Sales
    Support
    Team
    etc

these folder names are the same across all my project’s inboxes.

hotkey: use your keyboard’s arrows to move up/down your Gmail inbox, “x” to select a message, then “v” to move it to a folder. (note, you must enable Shortcuts inside Settings first)

protip: “shift+?” to see all Gmail keys.

i don’t trust people with 100s of emails in their inbox. even if they’re Read, that many messages prevents deep thinking required to build great products.

## 9. Arquivos

similar to my thoughts on Inbox Zero, i keep my computer very clean.

    NOTHING in the Downloads folder
    NOTHING in the Documents folder
    EVERYTHING neatly organized in Dropbox + Drive
    1-2 [working] files or folders on my Desktop

not only is this less stressful than a machine full of files, it allows me to toggle effortlessly between my iMac and MacBook Pro.

this year i’ve traveled to several countries and 20(?)+ cities, with another 7-10 to go before Christmas 2018. if i’m not vigilant about file management, i’m screwed.

## 10. Editores de texto

i spend ~20% of my day coding or reviewing code. for this reason it makes sense to keep my text editor (Atom) open at all times.

when i’m not coding i enjoy writing in Markdown flavor (text file with “.md” extension) which i later transpose to emails or Google Docs if the notes are useful.

taking notes in a Text editor, split screen on my left, is especially handy during phone calls. i save these files to my Desktop and process them (email / G Doc / trash) on a daily basis.

## 11. Mensageiros instantâneos

i don’t use Slack to stay productive, i use it because there isn’t a better alternative.

a few mentionable channels:

    #installs –> live feed of signups
    #growth –> marketing wins
    #dev –> GitHub commits, deployments, etc
    #til –> fact sharing, geek articles

yes, i’m logged into Slack ~24/7 on my computers as well as my phone.

on rare occasions i close Slack completely, like a demo call with screen sharing or to go heads down on a project.

part of my management style, however, is being present for my team to remove blockers. i prioritize that over sanity all day.

## 12. Projetos

perhaps the real reason you’re reading this is to figure out how i alternate multiple companies in my daily schedule.

the short answer is, i don’t.

according to Ashlee Vance’s interviews with Elon Musk for the autobiography with the same title, Elon spends a full day at Tesla’s office, say Monday or Tuesday. then on Wednesday he spends all day at SpaceX and catches up on emails for both companies that evening.

i’m no Musk, but the framework is accessible to all of us. here’s my personal adaptation of this method, applied to my Calendar:

    Monday night, 6-9p, code XYZ new feature for Lobiloo.com
    Tuesday morning, 9-11a, draft product spec for a new Fork Equity venture
    Wednesday afternoon, 3-4p, run 5k and bike 5k
    Friday morning, 9-10a, clear Cross Sell inbox
    Saturday, 10a-5p, record video lectures for SaaS Marketing Bootcamp

of course, i won’t pretend to only “hack” on Lobiloo, or any of these above projects, solely during the 1-2x /week scheduled period.

however, i’ve observed this is the best way to move the needle* on a side project, while staying focused on the Main Thing™ during regular business hours. it also relieves me of inaction anxiety, aka the pain we feel when not working on something that needs attention.

if i know this Wednesday is stubbed out as a Lobiloo hack night, i don’t stress about blowing off a small bug on Monday. as for “urgent” tasks like customer support, i hire or delegate or build email alerts that ping me if something requires immediate attention.

## 13. Tempo livre

in addition to my tech stack and scheduling discipline, i’m careful with “free time.”

this is generally considered the 3-4 hours between dinner <> bed time, and ~all of Saturday + Sunday waking hours.

if there’s one secret or element that binds my entire process, it’s that i’ve worked every weekend and almost every evening for the past 2 years.

the schedule above, ie “Tuesday, 6-9p, do THIS” is a reality i’ve not only learned to accept but to enjoy. after all, we don’t consume what we like, we like what we consume.

back to business.

nobody says you have to work from home. sometimes i’ll visit Ace Hotel, or get a steak dinner first (+ wine), or hack at a salad spot that doesn’t close until 9 or 10p.

changing scenery is like the end of a meal; you’re totally stuffed from the entree but “still have room” for dessert. when our physical environment changes, so does our energy.

this, in a sentence, is why i’m nervous about moving to Austin or ~any suburban-esque geography.

living in big cities like New York provides an unfair advantage to my energy, since most Americans (my competitors) live in dull environments with a “what’s on Netflix?”  post dinner sentiment. sigh.

in the past few months i’ve been:

    asked to meet for coffee dozens of times (80% success rate saying “no”)
    requested for interviews on podcasts (100% success rate saying “no”)
    invited to special dinners / events (50% success rate saying “no”)

i look forward to improving my probability of saying no, while also improving my ability to not offend when* i say no. today i re-read Paul Graham’s Maker vs Manager essay to inspire new ideas.

## 14. Resumo

if you’re unhappy with your output, say “no” to things that don’t increase productivity.

if you struggle to motivate yourself after dinner, change your scenery. find a late night cafe or hotel with a decent lobby + wifi situation.

if you enjoy life too much (friends, drinking) to spend more time besides 9-5 at “work,” acknowledge one day you will stop breathing and probably no one will remember you.

it is here, in accepting our legacy, that we find contentment and gratitude.

you don’t need to be “remembered” to be successful, or “busy” to be fulfilled, but whatever your legacy wishes, you will be more effective in achieving it if you’re more productive.

now get back to work.
