Aqui estão as histórias mais interessantes que eu li na web nessa semana. As escolhas frequentemente são de jornalismo longform, contos e entrevistas. Vale lembrar: só porque as achei interessante, não significa que as endosso.

1. [I Called Off My Wedding. The Internet Will Never Forget](https://www.wired.com/story/weddings-social-media-apps-photos-memories-miscarriage-problem/) [wired.com]

"This monetization of emotional memory isn’t just off-putting in theory; it can also inhibit personal growth, as I was slowly learning." (...) "Eichhorn argues that the people most deeply affected by digital memories are those who stand to gain the most by being allowed to reinvent themselves." (...) "Life is marked by change, a series of graduations from one phase to the next, even if it doesn’t involve a cap and gown or an official ceremony. And, Eichhorn notes, there’s been surprisingly little written about the specific impact of our digital culture on memory.

2. [How the US can solve the global vaccine shortfall](https://www.agglomerations.tech/how-the-us-can-solve-the-global-vaccine-shortfall/) [agglomerations.tech]

"It seems unlikely that suspending the IP rights will do much to accelerate production in isolation and it could significantly diminish the incentives for investing in the future. On the other hand, a full technology buyout — which includes the IP rights and incentives to work with foreign manufacturers — could simultaneously activate any latent capacity that may exist while also giving the developing world an opportunity to bootstrap their own vaccine manufacturing capabilities."

3. [The Ponzi Career](https://www.drorpoleg.com/the-ponzi-career/) [drorpoleg.com]

"Public blockchains like Ethereum make it easy to issue and trade tokens to reflect ownership rights over any physical or digital product." (...) "The best way to handle the risks and uncertainty of scalable occupations is to share them."

"In such a scenario, every career becomes a pyramid scheme. If you can attract enough people to buy your tokens, and they can attract enough people to buy even more tokens, the whole enterprise will continue to increase in value. This increase will happen regardless of how much revenue you can generate from doing your actual job. And it will continue until you run out of stories to tell, or until you run out of people to tell stories to."

4. [Against alcohol](https://fergus-mccullough.com/index.php/2021/04/09/against-alcohol/) [fergus-mccullough.com]

"[P]rovides a summary of the latest science on the impact of alcohol, which I’ll briefly outline, and goes on to suggest some actions in light of that knowledge."

5. [Tracking down the original server that Yahoo was hosted on before it was called Yahoo](https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/1381309822088323075) [twitter.com]

Yahoo antes de ser Yahoo. It doesn't get more web 1.0 than that.

6. [Why We’re Freaking Out About Substack](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/11/business/media/substack-newsletter-competition.html) [nytimes.com]

"So the biggest threat to Substack is unlikely to be the Twitter-centric political battles among some of its writers. The real threat is competing platforms with a different model. The most technically powerful of those is probably Ghost, which allows writers to send and charge for newsletters, with monthly fees starting at $9. While Substack is backed by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, Ghost has Wikipedia vibes: It is open-source software developed by a nonprofit."

"But Ghost represents an even purer departure from legacy media. More than half of the sites on the platform simply run the software off their own servers. (...) “The technology is designed to be decentralized, and there’s no one institution or one corporation that can decide what is OK,” he said."

7. [How People Get Rich Now](http://www.paulgraham.com/richnow.html) [paulgraham.com]

"The best way to envision what happened is to imagine a pond with a crust of ice on top. Initially the only way from the bottom to the surface is around the edges. But as the ice crust weakens, you start to be able to punch right through the middle. (...) The edges of the pond were pure tech: companies that actually described themselves as being in the electronics or software business. When you used the word "startup" in 1990, that was what you meant. But now startups are punching right through the middle of the ice crust and displacing incumbents like retailers and TV networks and car companies."

8. [Turns Out, Spock Is Kinda Bad at Logic](https://www.wired.com/2021/04/geeks-guide-spock-logic/) [wired.com]

"Not only does Spock have a terrible track record—events he describes as “impossible” happen 83 percent of the time—but his confidence level is actually anti-correlated with reality."
