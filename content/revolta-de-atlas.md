```“There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs.” -John Rogers```

One thought came to mind, it's not a bad 300ish page book. Unfortunately it's like a million pages long. If half the page count was cut, it wouldn't be as bad as it was. 

The concepts are interesting. The politics are simplistic and unrealistic, but you could say the same thing about 1984, Hand Maiden's Tale or Brave New World.

As a piece of writing, it's not any good. It reads like pulp function- the characters are all larger-than-life and impossibly-good heroes. The villains are unsympathetic and wholly evil. Her writing indicates a puerile understanding of humanity. The fact that she bases a philosophic ideal off of this puerile understanding isn't promising.

---

I personally, having read both Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead, would say that The Fountainhead is actually quite good. Yes, it's got some problems stemming from Rand's philosophy and her own weird rape fetish that gets injected into one particular character.

Atlas's problem is that it reads like a much longer, more brow beating version of The Fountainhead. I actually think that can be an enjoyable read, though it still has a court scene that's basically the author speaking through her character. Thankfully, it's shorter than it was in Atlas Shrugged.

---

Alternately, you could just pick up The Virtue of Selfishness if you want her philosophy laid out without even the pretense of a plot.

---

> In my own opinion, regardless of what you think of Objectivism as a philosophy, I did not like Atlas Shrugged as I found the characters rather wooden and the dialogue a bit too oratorical and histrionic. It was also longer than I felt it needed to be by at least half. The same story could have been told just as effectively in a far shorter novel without sacrificing anything.


---

Em resumo, 

The premise of the story is fine. The writing is poor. The overt political overtones in the book are obvious and silly.

It is possible to enjoy a book from an author you don't agree with on any level (i.e. see Ender's Game) but it requires the book to actually stand up on its own merit and be well written.

I mean this as someone attempting to show sympathy to Ayn Rand: I do not believe judging the novel by conventional literary standards is "fair". It fails in almost every capacity as a conventional novel. The only positive thing I think that can be said for it is something that often can be said for bad writing, surprisingly: it can be a bit of a page turner.

Why this is not a compliment is that it speaks to Rand's unintentional repetition, lack of focus, and the ability to skim large sections of the book without feeling that a person has missed anything. When people get heavily invested in reading, they often skim words and even sentences. You can skim full paragraphs with Rand at absolutely no cost.

The novel reads like a piece of art brut. It's written by someone who seems to lack any sort of conventional literary education, and who further went so far as to decide that the way to become a self taught novelist was not to teach ones self the conventional aspects of a literary education with the freedom and independence that a autodidacticism can provide. Instead, she seems to have barreled through anything she may have read in her life with no respect for the works or the authors. As novels go, I have not seen the movie "The Room" but Atlas Shrugged is probably in the same category.

Rand does not have any sense of conversation or how people act. The lengthy monologues are unforgivable. Almost all characters are characterized in the same few ways. There is no sense of character development for any except for John Galt, and in a very slight way Dagny. The characters seem completely incapable of forming emotional bonds. If someone were to hand me the novel, I would advise they see a psychiatrist.

This has nothing to say about the politics. I'm comparing Atlas Shrugged to the books it most seems to want to imitate: that is, the idea novels of writers like Dostoyevsky.

To claim that it's unfair to put Rand on the same platform as Dostoyevsky ignores that her followers regularly declare her superiority to most other novelists and place her in the same category. Further, there are "idea novelists" that write significantly better novels that still have an overall conservative bent: Milan Kundera's work.

Practically every sci-fi novel attempts a similar level of social critique and analysis as voiced in Rand. None of these things are exceptional.

I can complain about her politics and argue against them indefinitely. However, my problem with Ayn Rand as a writer has absolutely nothing to do with her politics.


Her work is not something I'll ever be returning to.

## Porque eu acho um livro ruim

TL;DR She relies on strawmen.

In 2020, I read both The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged and saw the movie adaptations of these two books. I will state upfront that I went in not agreeing with Rand's libertarian worldviews, and I read these books mainly because I believe you should not shy away from reading the viewpoints of people who disagree with you. All of Rand's books try to argue for a philosophy she calls Objectivism, which states that what we experience is objective reality, morality is whatever advances the happiness of the individual, government serves no purpose other than to protect property, and we should value facts and logic above emotion. It's similar to libertarianism but extends those ideas to more than just politics.

I read The Fountainhead first, and my criticism was that the characters in the book do not feel like real people, and because they don't feel like real people, any moral lessons applied in the book, at best, are unproven. To put it another way, if we take the statement "If P is true then Q is true," and we take P to be "the characters in the book act like real people" and Q to be "the moral lessons the characters learn can be applied to real life," and if P is false, then we cannot deduce what Q is. For an example of a book with heavy political overtones that does not fail this test, Animal Farm sets up a believable scenario which shows why communism would be appealing to the citizens of the recently disposed Tsar in Russia, and how Stalin would be able to abuse those systems to be able to establish himself as dictator. Despite not having very many literal humans, Animal Farm's characters more accurately represent a microcosm of humanity than any human character in The Fountainhead. I don't mind fictional stories that have the primary intention of being a vehicle to explain the author's worldview, and I don't mind if that worldview conflicts with my own. I don't agree with everything Bradbury says in Fahrenheit 451 but I still think that book is worth reading. I mention all this because, in my opinion, if you are going to have your book be a political allegory, having characters behave believably is an important ingredient for making that allegory effective. To point out an example of why I thought the characters in The Fountainhead were unrealistic, the book opens with our hero, Howard Roark, getting expelled from school for being too hardworking, too intelligent, and too innovative. I'm sorry, but what school expels it's students for being too smart? In my experience any university would be trilled to have a student like this; they would laud Roark with praise as he graduated, and if he made it big in the world, they would proudly display his name in a list of notable alumni to use him as an advertisement to get more students to attend that university. The whole interaction reads like it was written by someone who did poorly in university and doesn't want to take responsibility for it because they have a massive persecution complex. "They hate me because I'm so amazing," is a running motif of her works, and, "Who does this?" will be a running motif of this essay.

Then came Atlas. This book argues for more or less the same philosophy as The Fountainhead, but the writing is more raw, more authentic to her personality, which means that everything you could love or hate about The Fountainhead is amplified up to 11 in Atlas Shrugged. Fans of hers will argue that this is her Magnum Opus, while I think this is the worst book I've ever read. While I thought the characters in The Fountainhead were unrealistic, compared to Atlas Shrugged, I at least get the sense she was trying to have believable characters, were as in Atlas Shrugged I can't view the characters, either the heroes or villains, as Rand mouthpieces. There was one scene where she had two lovers expressing their love for one another by lecturing each other on the merits of individualism and the end result is that I can't see them as human. Whenever one of Rand's heroes spoke, my visual imagination would have my mental depiction of the character in question slowly morph into Rand as the monologue went on, and the same thing would happen with the villains, except Rand would have a mocking tone of voice. Admittedly this was a problem in The Fountainhead, but in that book, characters would often talk to each other in between the political monologues, where as Atlas Shrugged, the plot is just a vehicle to unload as many of these monologues onto the reader as possible.

Atlas Shrugged opens with the sibling railroad tycoons Dagny and James Taggart arguing about business. James wants to help those who are less fortunate, while Dagny only wants to make money. In most stories, James would be the hero and Dagny would be the villain who by the end would realize the error of her selfish ways and would come around to James' way of thinking. But no, it's the other way around, James is the one who realizes he's wrong at the end. James will say something about the helping the needy and Dagny will gasp! "How could you say something so horrible? What insanity is the world coming to!" You may think I'm exaggerating Rand's response to charity, but I assure you that the writing really is that melodramatic. So you have siblings with diametrically opposed worldview, one with Rand's Objectivist philosophy and one without. She makes the case for Objectivism not by making you sympathize with Dagny, because she assumes right off the bat that you are as horrified as Dagny is with giving to the poor, she makes her case by demonizing James and by extension, his Collectivist worldview. Now Rand very rarely uses the word collectivism, but I need to use that as a shorthand for everything the villains in Atlas Shrugged believe, because everything Rand doesn't like all gets amalgamated into one ideology. For example, let's say you like abstract art. According to Rand, that means you hate facts and logic which means you are a (caricature of a) postmodernist which means you don't believe in free will which means you don't believe in the power of the human spirit which means you like charity which means you are a (caricature of a) communist which means you hate talent which means you don't believe in personal responsibility which means you are fat and ugly which means you have low self esteem which means you have bad taste in romantic partners which means you are bad at lovemaking. Yes, she actually goes there. If she somehow made the book even longer I bet she would have thrown in that collectivists are only collectivists because they have small penises or breasts. Apparently these black and white character traits were intentional. Rand made her Objectivist heroes to be handsome Supermen and her Collectivist villains mustache twirling evildoers because she wanted to make sure there was no incorrect interpretations of her work. This type of thinking is what turns her work from political allegory worth discussing into political propaganda. In 2012 Clint Eastwood debated an empty chair that was supposed to be a stand in for Obama. The whole segment gives off some "crotchety old conservative man yells at cloud" vibes, and he may be like that in real life, but the films he directs are actually quite nuanced. Despite his public appearance as a typical angry conservative, I can tell from his films that he can look at an issue from many different angles and sympathize with all of them. I can look at those films and get the sense that he respects me, as someone who disagrees with him, as an intelligent person, and I respect his intelligence more for it, which makes me more likely to be accepting of his viewpoints if we had a dialogue. Rand does not respect me in the same way so I respect her intelligence less for it.

So Rand has a bunch of villains whose motivation is to help the poor. How does she make them look bad? Well everyone who says we should help the poor is a pathetic, sniveling, stupid, vile person. And here we see the first contradiction in Rand's philosophy, and objectivism posits that we should only value logic and not emotion, yet portraying everyone who disagrees with her as an idiotic loser worthy of contempt is a purely emotional argument. She will put her villains that her heroes don't have to deal with in a dishonest manner. For example, midway through the novel there is a hunger shortage, and someone watches their relative die of hunger as a result. When this persons asks one of the evil collectivists professors about it, and he responds that she can't know he's dead because humans don't have free will or something. This is a pretty awful response, but keep in mind, it's a response by a strawman. How would Rand respond to this scenario? She portrays people who want handouts as lazy moochers (her words), so if someone starves to death because they can't afford food during an economic catastrophe, would she just tell him to quit being so lazy and get a damn job, because it's not her problem? A big part of her philosophy is not living for another man, that's how she justifies not helping people. Early in the book, Dagny is on a train that has stopped, she asks the lead engineer what the hold up is, and he responds that he sees an emergency light and has to stop but doesn't know what the emergency is. Dagny tells him that this is stupid and they should ignore the warning light and go full speed ahead. Because apparently, potentially causing a fatal accident is nowhere near as bad as running late for a meeting. This time, things go off without a hitch and this section is a minor footnote in the overall story. But later, you have an evil collectivist politician make the exact same decision under the exact same circumstances for the exact same reason and it causes a huge catastrophe that claims the lives of hundreds of people. Rand never points out the parallels between these two incidents and I don't think she's even aware of them. There are more instances where an objectivist hero will do something and you are supposed to root for them but later when a collectivist villain will do the exact same thing you are supposed to despise them for it. This is the type of inconsistent messaging which shows how poorly thought out the basis for her philosophy is.

Another great irony is that despite the heroes of Rand's world claiming that selfishness is a virtue (I am not kidding, that is the name of one of her non-fiction books), her villains display more selfishness than her heroes do, despite claiming to be charitable. Towards the end of the book, capitalist ubermensch John Galt snatches up all the billionaires and great thinkers of the world and puts them all in an isolated community in the middle of nowhere where they don't have to live with the parasitic collectivist looters who demand that said billionaires pay their employees minimum wage. There is one rule, you can't use the word "give" you can only use the word "earn." So basically, if you said to your friend, "Hey I need to talk to you, can you give me a minute." He should respond with, "No, you need to earn that minute." You may think I'm being overly literal with the wording but that's how that rule is applied in the novel. John Galt needs to borrow another millionaires car, so the millionaire lends him the car for the day for 25 cents. Keep in mind, everyone in the valley owns millions of dollars. 25 cents is nothing to me, so it would definitely be nothing to them. He may as well be giving that car away for free. And this isn't the only time this happens despite everyone in this commune being worth millions, everyone is charging a dollar or two for their goods and services. This is such little money compared to what everyone has in their bank accounts that they may as well be working for free, but this isn't a problem, because scarcity doesn't exist and everyone is willing to work to keep the community thriving. In other words, Galt capitalists so hard he creates a communist utopia. John Galt also doesn't allow trade with the outside world, which sound suspiciously like government regulation to me. The most outrageous moment for me comes with the relationship between Dagny and John Galt. When Dagny crash lands into this free-market-communist village, John Galt holds her prisoner at his own house and charges her rent while he is doing so. Because he can't give Dagny a prison cell, she must earn that prison cell. Dagny has millions of dollars in the bank account, but can't use it for some convoluted reason. The real reason is that Rand wants Dagny to fall in love with John, and she does of course. So John charges Dagny 50 cents a day for the service of keeping her prisoner, and will give her a dollar per day if she makes him breakfast. First thing, who in the real world charges 50 cents a day for rent? For Rand's insistence that we look at actual facts to derive truth, she sure does ignore these facts a lot of the time. And second, this is the same logic sex traffickers use to keep their victims imprisoned. They'll put up an ad for a modeling agency, only for the model to be imprisoned in some basement. The have to pay off the debt from the plane ticket to the agency/sex trafficking front, and the only way to make money is to service the clients of the sex traffickers. Not only do they only get a small percentage of money from this transaction, but they also have to use that to pay for their own food and the rent of their prison cells. They could refuse, but then they don't get to eat, and they are only going to increase their debt from their prison rent. This system ensures that the victims never make enough money to pay their way out. John Galt charges Dagny 50 cents a day for keeping her prisoner and pays her 1 dollar for making him breakfast, but he is the one who picks those amounts, he could easily charge her 40 dollars a day and making breakfast only pays off 50 cents, but to make off the difference, she has to engage in "other services," Dagny would have zero choice in the matter, and John Galt would be completely justified in Rand's worldview. He only reason he doesn't is out of the kindness of his heart, but remember, he thinks selfishness is a virtue. Dagny is at the mercy of someone who thinks greed is good and that something is moral if it makes you happy regardless of how it affects other people. It's not a stretch to say that Atlas Shrugged is pro human trafficking, and this is not me taking her premises to an absurd extreme, she does all the hard work for me and makes these comparisons herself in her own book where she's trying to make this worldview look good. I would not have made the pro-human-trafficking connection if Rand didn't spell it out for me.

In contrast to the heroes, Rand's villains actually follow Rand's philosophy. Outside of Galt's Gulch, where you have people espousing the virtue of selfishness then giving their products away for next to nothing, you have the evil collectivists who espouse the virtues of charity, only to stab each other in the back for personal and political profit. You see, they may claim to want to help others, but in Rand's mind, no one actually wants to help others. She describes helping others as being a slave to their incompetence. Never mind actual slavery, which was a huge problem for most of human history and still is today, no, the real monsters of society are things like PBS.org. This is something she defines in The Fountainhead, but in Atlas Shrugged, she assumes you already know and agree with her, thus when she uses terms like slavery, you should be aware that she's actually talking about paying taxes or donating money to St. Jude's, as opposed to actual slavery. This is one of the ways Atlas Shrugged is a rawer version of The Fountainhead. So when her collectivist villains say you should help others, it's part of some convoluted money making scheme to try to enrich their own bank accounts. This is obviously a bad thing, but under Rand's worldview, I don't see why it would be? She says that a person's moral and productive worth in society is tied directly to how much money you have in your bank account, and that intentions can only be pure when money is involved. She literally says this, I cannot make this up. One might argue that obtaining money through lying would not be moral, but according to Rand, why not? She defines morality doing whatever makes you happy and integrity as integrity to an idea. If you are confused about what integrity to an idea means, it means that all of her characters are one-dimensional, and you should be too. Three dimensional people don't have integrity. So, if people lie to enrich themselves at the cost of others, why would that be immoral? They're making themselves happy. She thinks her worldview is one where the hardworking, intelligent John Galt's of the world would thrive, but in reality she's paving the way for the scumbags like Wesley Mooch to thrive. Her justification for the premise that intentions can only be pure when money is involved is based on the idea that if a billionaire wants to gain more money the only way they can do this is to work harder to produce a better product. In the real world, you have people like Martin Shkreli who made his medicine 50 times more expensive overnight because he knew his customers had very little say in the matter, it was either go bankrupt or die. He did not work 50 times as hard to produce a product that was 50 times better, he did that because he was being selfish, and if he were more discrete about it he might have gotten away with it.

People like Shkreli are why the market needs to be regulated. She portrays the government as impossibly corrupt and never makes the connection that businesses can also be corrupt. In the world of Atlas Shrugged, billionaires are a persecuted class of people that everyone loves, which leads into the question of, if everyone loves them, who is persecuting them? This is a frequent problem where she needs her heroes to be adored and victims at the same time. Rand will talk about how the masses will boo any movie when a CEO character comes on screen, but when Hank Rearden gives a speech about how brilliant he is for making money, and then the crowd erupts into a round of applause. The scene is about as believable as your average post on /r/thathappened She doesn't understand why people don't like the super rich. People don't hate Elon Musk because he invented and sells an electric car, they hate him because he underpays and overworks his employees, and doesn't care about their health regulations regarding Covid, although he certainly cares about his own. But in Atlas Shrugged workers who complain about little things like safety measures are portrayed as lazy and unreasonable.

Rand not understanding issues she is trying to refute is a huge part of her why her arguments don't work. In the beginning, they pass the Anti-Dog-Eat-Dog rule and our hero Dagny laments how this is the end of the world. Like I said, the prose is very melodramatic. At first I thought it was a government anti-trust regulation, but when watching the film, I realized that it was businesses colluding with each other so they would agree to not compete with each other. No business wants to sign the rule, but they all peer pressure each other somehow. So this isn't an anti-trust regulation, it's the opposite, it's a trust. They are illegally colluding to form a monopoly. I am against this, I absolutely think in scenarios like these, the government should come in and break up the trust, but Rand can't argue this because the government doing anything is bad. Other passages even support the ideas of monopolies, as they imply that monopolies happen because a business produces such a great product that no one wants to use anything else, and that anti-monopoly laws work by forcing people to by from the inferior business. So she thinks trusts are anti-business and she doesn't understand how regulation works or why people want it in the first place. Getting such basic facts wrong about government regulation is a huge black mark on her ability to argue why government regulation is ineffective. She believes government regulation exists because the government wants to punish hardworking intelligent individuals. That they only make laws to put them in jail. Gee, people profiting from others being put in jail are also the people writing the laws? That sounds a lot like for-profit prisons, but Rand can't mention that, because apparently intentions are only pure when money is involved.

This all culminates towards the end where Ayn Rand John Galt reveals herhis unhinged mannifesto inspiring speech. I know I've said the book was political monologue after political monologue, but this one is by far the longest and most memorable and not in a good way. It lays out the premises for Objectivism bare. It is 70 pages long. I listened to this on audiobook and it took about 4 hours for the narrator to get through all of it. If I were more educated in philosophy I would probably tackle this more in depth in another post. I could probably write a blog where I go chapter by chapter and explain everything wrong with this book, there is so much here I have to leave out because I don't have room to mention it, but that would require that I reread this book and I am not eager to do this. I will say that this manifesto, like the rest of the book, relies on strawmen. She tells me what people like me supposedly believe only to point out contradictions in it, but I don't actually believe what she's saying I do and I don't know anyone who does. For example, Ayn Galt says "Go into any university classroom and they will teach you that electricity is an act of faith." Wait what? Every physics classroom I've been in does not teach that electricity is an act of faith but rather tries to get the students to understand electricity with mathematical precision. When she portrays university intellectuals as trying to stop the student's from using their brains as part of their collectivist agenda, the criticism runs hollow because of statements like that. Later he says "You demand that we give to charity but when asked where the charity money comes from you blankout!" No, the charity money comes from people who give to charity, that isn't that hard a question. She says that collectivists curse the scientists and philosophers who made society what it is, but how many janitors go around saying "Curse you Isaac Newton! Curse you Friedrich Nietzsche!" What's hilarious about this is that she never actually brings up the philosophers and science that supposedly support her ideas. In the afterword she gives a shoutout to Aristotle, but if she wants to argue that philosophy supports her, then she might want to cite some of them throughout the novel, to at least give off the impression that she knows a thing or two about the field she claims to be an expert in. The science aspect is worse. At one point, earlier in the novel, the government scientist declare Rearden metal unsafe for no reason. It's implied they are corrupt shills, although for whom are they shilling for? I viewed this as analogous to climate change. So Rand says we should listen to what scientists have to say, unless the scientists say something we don't like and we can just ignore them.
