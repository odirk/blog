so like i was trying to think about that and there's nothing that that jumps to mind. and this isn't really a habit, but i think something really good that has stuck with me that came out of my previous career as a teacher was (again this is a little hard to articulate) but what i want to try to express here is that, like we were talking about before you have these different phases of life right? and you start out and you're a kid and you're not responsible for anything, and like that's what being a child is is like.  you're an idiot and everyone else is responsible for your actions, but not you. and you start going to school and society tries to civilize you from being like this little monster into a person who can tie his shoes or whatever

and as you go through school you're growing up and you're becoming more of a person and then you leave school and you go out into the real world and you still have this transitionary period where you're new at the job and so people can still treat you in a less serious way but you're still in the real world.

i have a very particular moment it wasn't really anything but like for me this was really defined as like a moment that it just really struck me as "oh this is real now" like everything is is serious. there's no playing around anymore you know we're not bowling with those inflatable things on either side of the runway right. it's like "no no this is this is the real world" and i would translate this as like it helped me really become serious in

oh are you seriously trying to go out on your own and become self-employed are you being serious about it or are you doing things that feel like they're working towards this goal but they aren't really

and

the the thing that really struck me

about it is

it's like hey guy well you'll know every

day if you haven't been serious enough

because

you're still coming in here to the

school to work and it literally took me

years i mean probably timeline wise it

still took me like five years to

actually go self-employed from that

moment

maybe four years but it was just a

realization of like this is really for

real in in

you know like these moments in life

where you just kind of you have a mental

change or you realize like now this

phase of life is fundamentally different

than the things that have come before

that's something that's really

stuck with me and it's a framework that

i tend to apply to a lot of things

let's put this way like you see a group

of people and they're they're trying to

achieve objective x

and a very important question is to ask

are these people

actually serious about trying to achieve

objective x no matter what it is

and

i wish i could like articulate in

in more precise words what i mean by

that but it's like something that i got

in this moment of like a real clarity of

like this group

looks like they're trying to achieve

objective x but if you were

serious about it

what would you do like if they want to

have a world where like

x doesn't exist anymore are the steps

they're taking

the steps that you would do if you were

serious about making a world without x

as soon as possible

in the same way that when i was working

as a teacher the question is like what

do i

really need to do

so that i wake up one morning and i

don't come in to work as a teacher

because i am actually supporting myself

through self-employment like there's

lots of things that can

look like you're working towards that

goal but they're not serious they're

like play-acting towards it in some way

so

yeah i i think

that's not exactly like a habit or

something but it's a kind of change of

mind

that

very clearly happened and has definitely

carried forward with me and is something

i think about a lot of like am i being

serious about this thing or like is this

person serious about this thing that

they claim that they're interested in

some way or another and the answer is

very frequently no

but like that's a different topic i can

kind of see

how that spreads across the good and bad

right where like it's good for you to be

able to realize that in yourself

but it could be bad because you would

maybe be more quick to judge someone on

whether they are making that decision

for themselves i don't think it is bad

to make that judgment i think it is

informative to make that judgment right

about what the situation is i do also

think that it has come up on the the

show many like i'm not the best with

people

but there's a there's a way in which

i don't know maybe maybe this is this is

helpful for people who are like me where

you come across a person and like

they're working on thing y and they

claim that they're very interested and

serious about thing why

but you judge that like oh they're not

actually doing the things that if you

sat down and like wrote them all on a

piece of paper like what is the most

cost effective per unit time thing that

you should be working on in order to do

this

like they're not doing any of the things

that are at the top of that list they're

doing all the things that are at the

bottom of that list

it's not a

it's not a judgment that that like that

person is

bad it's just a kind of like oh okay

well they're like they're just not

serious about that

and and that's that's fine

i don't know i find it like it's helpful

whereas it would be more frustrating in

a way to kind of like

take them at their word that they really

mean this it's like no but you don't

you're you're just acting as though this

is a thing that like you're very

interested in fixing this problem but

like it doesn't actually seem that

you're doing any of the things that

would do that so yeah i don't know i

think it's just it's a useful framework

that i can't articulate any better than

just this simple word of like serious or

do you really mean it

and there's some kind of objective

measure in the world that would be

different about it you know like maybe

uh going back to that thing about

writing it is such a it's such a dumb

joke but it always stuck with me there's

like a really old joke from family guy

about brian working on a novel and

there's like all these clips of stewie

giving him a hard time about like the

novel he's working on and that

encapsulates like people who aren't

serious about doing a thing it's like

how's that novel you're working on right

like because everyone knows with that

joke

you know people who are in these

situations of like they want to be a

writer and is like okay do you know what

writers do they write

the book we've all got that great novel

right like everyone's got that in them

on the flip side to be quite harsh about

it it's like you know what writers don't

do they don't go to classes about how to

write a novel they don't get phd's in

english literature it's like and this is

again one of these things of

it's sort of obvious to say but if you

just think about it for a second it's

like oh

how many of the great and successful

writers in the world

have formal education backgrounds in

english and writing the answer is like

basically none of them and if they do

they were all already writing before

that happened and like they got those

jobs because they were writers

so that's like an articulation of the

seriousness like you want to be a writer

oh but you're getting your phd in

english literature like you're immediate

you're not serious about this at all

like you're doing something that sounds

and looks like it's towards the goal but

is like but isn't really so anyway

that's a more of a mindset but i feel

like that came out of

working in school and trying to become

self-employed

and just really having this realization

of like oh there's a totally objective

measure about whether or not you've

achieved your goal here and it's whether

or not you're still coming in to work at

the school

and so

what actually really needs to happen to

change that in the real world and that's

what you need to focus on if you are

quote serious about accomplishing that

goal which again still took me many

years but i think it wouldn't have

happened if i hadn't kind of like

in a particular moment had this

realization and this mental framing for

things
