## THE ART OF LIVING

- [Self Reliance by Ralph Waldo Emerson:](https://emersoncentral.com/texts/essays-first-series/self-reliance/)

> "We but half express ourselves, and are ashamed of that divine idea which each of us represents. … God will not have his work made manifest by cowards. A man is relieved and gay when he has put his heart into his work and done his best; but what he has said or done otherwise, shall give him no peace.”

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- [Siddhartha by Herman Hesse:](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2500/2500-h/2500-h.htm)

Siddhartha has been a constant companion of mine since age 16. The book reveals new gems every time I re-read it, but the following is my favourite: When Siddhartha is asked what he has to contribute, he responds:

> “I can think, I can wait, I can fast”.

Armed with effective mental models (“think”), an ability to foresee the longterm implications of his actions (“wait”) and a high pain tolerance (“fast”) Siddhartha ultimately attains all that he desires.

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

- [Principles by Ray Dalio:](https://www.principles.com/)

Dalio offers his principles for life and work - weaving them in with his own hero's journey. I revisit the first section (his principles for a meaningful life) quarterly and the following quote every week: 

> “Imagine that in order to have a great life you have to cross a dangerous jungle. You can stay safe where you are and have an ordinary life, or you can risk crossing the jungle to have a terrific life. How would you approach that choice? Take a moment to think about it because **it is the sort of choice that,** **in one form or another, we all have to make.”**

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## PARADIGM SHIFTS

‍I revisit these when I find myself overly anxious or nervous. There is something remarkably comforting in contemplating both death and the relative insignificance of human life. The folly of human ambition, greed and worry is made clear.

- [Pale Blue Dot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWPFmdAWRZ0&t=66s) by Carl Sagan
- [The Meaning of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srxDtefn740&t=185s) by Sam Harris
- [Regrets of the dying](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/01/top-five-regrets-of-the-dying)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## CAREER ADVICE

- [Naval's 'How to Get Rich Without Getting Lucky' Tweet Storm:](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1002103360646823936&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fmedia%2F7176a1ee4cdeec7e82b0139f16bb7a65%3FpostId%3Da5fd60ac5788)

That rare thing- a non-charlatanic guide to wealth creation. 

```
Naval's framework: specific knowledge + accountability + leverage + judgement = wealth. 
```

My current intuition is that young people should optimise for the first and second and they'll earn the third and develop the fourth over time. 

- [Pmarca's Guide to Career Planning:](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_career_planning_part0.html)

Maximise serendipity, become a double threat, and work in a young and dynamic industry. This is just a selection of the fantastic advice doled out by Marc Andreessen in his blog series on careers. 

- [How To Be Successful by Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful)

- [Elon Musk's Ex-Wife on What It Really Takes to Become a Billionaire](https://www.inc.com/quora/elon-musks-ex-wife-on-what-it-really-takes-to-beco.html)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## GOALS & PLANNING

### ‍Systems v Goals:

This idea, lionised in Jame Clear's 'Atomic Habits, has become the darling of the self-development world. 

Instead of setting goals and deferring satisfaction to some future date that may not (and usually doesn't) even arrive, set up systems that allow you to make a little progress each day. In short, aim to become a runner, not to run a marathon.

I still believe that there's a place for goals and continue to set them but have started to focus more on engineering systems to build towards them. 

```
Eg. System: Workout every morning at 6:30 AM 
    Goal: Run a marathon in 3:30 and reach 5% body fat.
```

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### ‍[How I Set and Execute 50 Year Goals by Serge Faguet:](https://hackernoon.com/how-i-set-and-execute-50-year-goals-why-i-see-cutting-in-lines-as-morally-right-f4d0ce28574f)

While I certainly don't agree with everything Serge writes, his approach to life is refreshingly unabashed. I'm inspired by his longterm-ism and love his take on setting instrumental goals- those that will help you in almost any pursuit- namely, persuasion, fitness and the ability to focus. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### [Taylor Pearson's Anti-Fragile Planning:](https://taylorpearson.me/planning/)

For somebody like me with the tendency to run headfirst after anything and everything shiny, this has been a godsend. The mistake most people make is they try and use their intelligence or knowledge to figure out the “right” thing to do in advance. Instead, you should generate a lot of options (and opportunities) and simply exercise the profitable ones when the conclusion is obvious.

&nbsp;

### [What Should You Do with Your Life? By Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/personal/what-should-you-do-with-your-life/)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## ‍PRODUCTIVITY

‍A common trope often cited when somebody offers productivity advice is that ***"there's no point climbing the ladder rapidly only to get to the top and realise that it was leaning against the wrong wall"***. ie. there's no point doing the wrong thing efficiently. 

The book that best explores this is [The Effective Executive](https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=sites&srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxzYWppdHRvdXJpc218Z3g6MjQ1N2M2OGQ4YWIwOTcyYw) by Pete Drucker. Once we've overcome this hurdle, there are plenty of ways to enhance efficiency. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Set Aside Large Quanta of Time:

This idea, taken from Drucker's aforementioned book, underpins most productivity books worth reading today. Namely: 

- [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) by Cal Newport 
- [The One Thing](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00D3J2QKW/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0) by Gary Keller. 
 
Basically, you need big blocks of uninterrupted time to focus deeply on one thing without being distracted by minutiae. This can be achieved through *['Time Blocking'](https://doist.com/blog/time-blocking/)* which Keller describes as "productivity’s greatest power tool.”

&nbsp;

### Favourite Blog Posts on Productivity:

[Ryan Kulp](https://www.ryanckulp.com/im-productive/), [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/productivity) and [Nat Eliason.](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/productive)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### [You and Your Research by Richard Hamming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j3zEcusTuA)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### [Scott Young's Little Book on Productivity.](Scott Young's Little Book on Productivity. )

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### Tiago Forte's P.A.R.A Method:

Personal knowledge management in a world of infinite information is a superpower. Tiago Forte is the leading authority on the subject and has coached over 20,000 people in the art of 'Building a Second Brain'. His courses are too dear for me as a college student but I've found Nat Eliason's [blog post](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam) about how to apply his approach to Roam Research (the latest, sexiest productivity tool) very helpful. 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### ‍[Parkinson's Law](https://fs.blog/2013/12/parkinsons-law/)

The adage that *'work expands to fill the time available for its completion'.*
