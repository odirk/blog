idk if it's the new UI thing or i'm just dumb, but on the old one when i was on artist's profile i could see and play every song and now i gotta click through the albums

Now once I arrive on the artist profile I have to click twice (first into "Discography" and then into a specific album) to even see any songs and I can only view the songs in one album at a time.

I can't even comprehend what the thinking was here. Are they trying to hide the songs? It was so much easier how it was before, having it all laid out right there on the artist page.

Weird design choice to couple song title and artist together into one column on a playlist but keep album, date added, and song length unique. The two most important filter criteria are the most annoying to filter by. Who decided that?

And give just as much screen real estate to Album and Date Added as the track title, which is guaranteed to be longer. Track title is almost always cut off and you can't even hover over it in now playing to scroll through it anymore.

My biggest problem with this new change is that when I click away from a playlist I'm currently listening to, go to another list and then back, it sends me on the top of the playlist, not where I've been/the active song.

I cannot emphasize enough how much I hate this. Such a simple functionality, but it makes all the difference in how much I enjoy listening to music. I have several playlists with 300+ songs in it, and I just want to not look for the one currently playing.

can't see exactly when new albums/singles were released

    Previous design you could see this at the top of the artist page in the Latest Release section. Now it's under the Discography section as "Latest Release" and clicking into it only shows you the release year

No persistent search bar
WHY IS THE SEARCH BAR HIDDEN BEHIND A CLICK NOW? 

Specific "Made For You" page now hidden in it's own card under the Search page

Whoever lead the new ui project must have failed their first year UI/UX course. Removing functionality and increasing the # clicks to do common actions like searching is embarrassing

Clicking on my profile on the top right takes me to a menu instead of just straight to my profile. Horrible. Atrocious. And WACK.

I HATE the tall, subtle black rectangles they put around the images in the Top Artists, Public Playlists, etc. sections of my profile. Totally unnecessary and shrinks the images of the playlist covers, album artwork, and band profile pictures. WACK.

The combining of song title and artist in the same column in playlists. It completely convolutes that information. The columns should go song title, artist, album, song length, date added. WACK.

I don’t understand the Find More thing at the bottom of a playlist. When you click it it just pulls up a search bar? Totally unnecessary. And totally WACK.

The black boundaries around the back/forward buttons and your profile at the top. Remove them from the back/foreward buttons and just put the circular profile icon in the top right. WACK.

The Create Playlist and Liked Songs options are pinned above your list of playlists. The Create Playlist could just be a plus icon on the top right, while Liked Songs should just be underneath Your Library with a similar style icon, or kept within the Your Library section. WACK.

The lack of songs being listed underneath albums in the Artist Page. They kind of address this with the See Discography section and being able to toggle between song and album view. That actually seems like a pretty decent solution to me as I do like the more condensed Artist Page, but need to use the new UI more before I decide if I like this change. Also very much wish a similar toggle was possible in playlists, allowing you to toggle between songs and album covers. WACK?

The menu bar next to Following on an artist page. I should just be able to follow/unfollow by clicking the Following text as a button (I can still follow this way but cannot unfollow). Radio, Report, and Share could just be icons after the Following button. WACK.

Followers and Following have become their own dedicated sections on your profile page (while also still being available through clicking on that same information under your name.) This information is not that important and doesn’t really deserve it’s own space, in my opinion. WACK.

The blue dot on top of profiles in the Friend Activity bar AND the actively listening icon after the name is redundant. Also the static bars are much less interesting than the animated speakers. WACK.

The top of my homepage has a section called Good Evening and has basically the same stuff in it as the Recently Played section just below it. WACK.

I wish the Discover, New Releases, and Made for You features (that are now in the Search section) had their own dedicated group within Search. Those are seperate from genres and I use them differently. WACK.

In Your Library, the sort by tab calls artists “creators"? Just kinda weird. That should just say artists. It already says artists in the menu at the top. WACK. (Again, cannot STAND the black boxes around the albums, artists, and playlists. Hate them so much. Very WACK indeed.)

I really don’t like how they present the songs within an album. I kind of like that they include the more concrete number of plays for each song but at the same time I don’t really care? The bars were much cleaner, and they could have just let you hover over the little bars that used to show a song’s popularity and see that information. Including the artist under the song title when you’re already in their album is redundant and like I brought up already, is a poor way of presenting that information. Should go song title, song length, plays. WACK.

The gap between the Friend Activity title and the actual Friend Activity feed is too large. I also think the word “Activity” should be capitalized. WACK.

They also condensed the song title and artist into the same line within the Friend Activity feed which makes it hard to read. WACK.

If I’m going through my Public Playlists, click on one of my playlists, then go back, it takes me back to the top of my playlists instead of where I was. WACK.

There is so much space on top of a playlist or album to include the play, like, download, etc. icons but instead they put them underneath the header in their own big chunk of space. They feel like they take up too much space and the list of songs starts too far down the page. They should either be smaller or included in the header. WACK.

Expanding the album art in the bottom left doesn’t fill up the entire space of the playlist bar. WACK.

The 3 dot menu bar underneath your profile header only has two things in it (edit profile and copy link to profile), both of which can easily be done without needing to use the menu bar (clicking on your name and right clicking on your name, respectively.) It’s totally unnecessary. WACK.

The More Like ’This Artist’ sections on the home page also include playlists and albums. I feel like those should just include other artists. WACK.

The adding of album artwork within playlists. They’re not really big enough to give you much information, and they make the body of the playlist too big and clunky. WACK.
