Leituras longas são as melhores histórias que eu li na web nessa semana. As escolhas de histórias frequentemente são de jornalismo longform, contos e entrevistas.

1. [I Called Off My Wedding. The Internet Will Never Forget](https://www.wired.com/story/weddings-social-media-apps-photos-memories-miscarriage-problem/)

"This monetization of emotional memory isn’t just off-putting in theory; it can also inhibit personal growth, as I was slowly learning." (...) "Eichhorn argues that the people most deeply affected by digital memories are those who stand to gain the most by being allowed to reinvent themselves." (...) "Life is marked by change, a series of graduations from one phase to the next, even if it doesn’t involve a cap and gown or an official ceremony. And, Eichhorn notes, there’s been surprisingly little written about the specific impact of our digital culture on memory.

2. [How the US can solve the global vaccine shortfall](https://www.agglomerations.tech/how-the-us-can-solve-the-global-vaccine-shortfall/)

"It seems unlikely that suspending the IP rights will do much to accelerate production in isolation and it could significantly diminish the incentives for investing in the future. On the other hand, a full technology buyout — which includes the IP rights and incentives to work with foreign manufacturers — could simultaneously activate any latent capacity that may exist while also giving the developing world an opportunity to bootstrap their own vaccine manufacturing capabilities."

3. [The Ponzi Career](https://www.drorpoleg.com/the-ponzi-career/)

"Public blockchains like Ethereum make it easy to issue and trade tokens to reflect ownership rights over any physical or digital product." (...) "The best way to handle the risks and uncertainty of scalable occupations is to share them."

"In such a scenario, every career becomes a pyramid scheme. If you can attract enough people to buy your tokens, and they can attract enough people to buy even more tokens, the whole enterprise will continue to increase in value. This increase will happen regardless of how much revenue you can generate from doing your actual job. And it will continue until you run out of stories to tell, or until you run out of people to tell stories to."

4. [Against alcohol](https://fergus-mccullough.com/index.php/2021/04/09/against-alcohol/)

"This useful little book provides a summary of the latest science on the impact of alcohol, which I’ll briefly outline, and goes on to suggest some actions in light of that knowledge."
